This is a project I am working on while learning concepts of data science and machine learning. The goal here is to identify whether a “news” article is fake or fact. We will take a dataset of labeled public-messages and apply classification techniques with frequency vectorizer. We can later test the model for accuracy and performance on unclassified public-messages. Similar techniques can be applied to other NLP applications like sentiment analysis etc.
